## Stock-Market-Analysis-Project
This project is designed to analyze various stock market data. Analyzed various metrics using Python and pandas such as trend and seasonality determination, rolling standard deviation, and correlation matrix. My goal was to extract insights that could provide valuable insights for customers.

## Just for fun, I presented this project through storytelling.

# ðŸ“ˆ Underneath Stock Market Data: Explorations and Insights.

# Slide 1: Introduction
"Today I will talk about how the stock market affects the economy, and why investors are so interested in it. In this presentation, I will share with you the experience of a stock market analysis project, which will help make data-based decisions about the market."

# Slide 2: Project Objectives
"The main objective of this project was to extract meaningful information from stock market data and provide important insights based on it. My aim was to analyze trends, seasonality, and volatility through various stock data. This paves the way for data-driven decision-making for investors. would be helpful."

# Slide 3: Data Collection and Processing
"In the first phase of the project, I collected stock market data from various sources. Then I ensured the quality of the data by removing redundant and incorrect information through a data cleaning process. This was very important to create a clean dataset through data processing."

# Slide 4: Preliminary analysis and statistics
"In this step, I did preliminary analysis and determined various statistical valuesâ€”such as mean price, median, and standard deviation. These statistics give us a basic idea of â€‹â€‹the general trend of the stock market and help us understand the initial state of the market."

# Slide 5: Time Series Analysis: Trend and Seasonality
"Through time series analysis I analyzed the long-term trend and seasonality of the stock market. Here the market trends are seen through moving average and seasonality analysis. It helped me to understand how stock prices have changed over time."

# Slide 6: Volatility Analysis
"Volatility means the degree of fluctuation in market prices. In this step, I analyzed the price fluctuations of various stocks using rolling standard deviation. This allowed us to see how some stocks were more volatile and some stocks were relatively stable."

# Slide 7: Top and Bottom Stock Analysis
"Here I have listed the top five and bottom five stocks based on average closing price. This list helps to assess which stocks are overvalued or undervalued in the market."

# Slide 8: Insights and Future Prospects
"Through this analysis, I have tried to find out what important information can be extracted for investing in the stock market. It can serve as an effective basis for predicting the future stock market and making informed decisions for investors."

# Slide 9: Conclusion
"This project helped me analyze stock market data and practice various concepts involved in it. It made the complex issues of stock market easier through data analysis."

# Slide 10: Question and Answer Session
"If you want to know more about this project or analysis or have any questions, I am ready to answer them."
